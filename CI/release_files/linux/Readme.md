Linux support is not well tested yet, built on ubunut 22.04 image so may have issues on older systems.
Requires OBS 28+.

Install:

* Put `libobs_google_caption_plugin.so` into your OBS plugins folder
    * Plugin folder location can vary a lot depending on distribution and/or installation source.
    * Usually also works in `$HOME/.config/obs-studio/plugins`
        * In that folder it needs to be in the required obs plugin folder structure:
        * `$HOME/.config/obs-studio/plugins/libobs_google_caption_plugin/bin/64bit/libobs_google_caption_plugin.so`
